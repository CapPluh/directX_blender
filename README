DirectX import-Export addon for Blender 2.6

first goals :

. to import anything from an .x file.
  obviously verts, faces but uv, armatures, weights, normals...
. import .x in binary format too

horizon :
. export to .x
. this project is also a prototype for a 'Blender Exchange Layer' project.
  BEL would be a common layer logically located between an importer/exporter
  addon and the blender data format, that would allow :
	. to provide a common set of methods to retrieve/inject objects in Blender
	. to provide a common set of transformation and selection tools between an
	  import/export script and Blender datas (rotate, rescale, filters...)
    . to provide a common set of parsing helpers for new io addons

PLY won't be used unfortunately (it's way too slow as far as I tested)
but directly the re module and certainly minidom for recent file format
